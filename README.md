# Event-management
Sandy Events is a basic HTML project that showcases an event announcement web page. The page is designed using pure HTML (no CSS frameworks or JavaScript) and demonstrates how to structure content for an events site with sections for upcoming events, a photo gallery, event details, and contact information.
